Given a string str consisting of only two characters 'a' and 'b'. You need to find the minimum steps required to make the string empty by removing consecutive a's and b's.

Input:
str = "bbaaabb"
Output:
2
Explanation:
Operation 1: Removal of all a's modifies str to "bbbb".
Operation 2: Removal of all remaining b's makes str
empty.
Therefore, the minimum number of operations required
is 2.


here the solution is very simple:
first we should count the total consecutive occurance of a nad b i.e for example if the string is aabbabbaa here b cconsecutively occurs 2 times
if we emove this b in 2 time than we are left with a consecutive sequence

so we find the mini of the consecutive repeatation of a and b and add +1 for the remaining reeatative occurance 

int minSteps(string str) {
    // Write your code here.
    	int a=0,b=0;
		if(str[0]=='a'){
		    a++;
		}else{
		    b++;
		}
		for(int i=1;i<str.length();i++){
		    if(str[i-1]=='a'&&str[i]=='b')
		    b++;
		    if(str[i-1]=='b'&&str[i]=='a')
		    a++;
		}
		
		return min(a,b)+1;
}
